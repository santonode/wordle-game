WURDLE
The rules of Wordle are to guess a five-letter word in six attempts. 
After each guess, the tiles of the letters change color to provide clues for your next attempt. 
There is only one new puzzle released each day. 

Basic gameplay
Start guessing: Type any valid five-letter word into the first row and press enter.
Evaluate the colored tiles: The game provides feedback on your guess with three colors:
Teal: The letter is correct and is in the right spot.
Yellow: The letter is in the word but is in the wrong position.
Red: The letter is not in the word at all.
Refine your guess: Use the color-coded clues to make a more informed guess in the next row.
Win or lose: Continue guessing until all tiles turn green, which means you have solved the word. 
If you run out of guesses, you lose the game for the day. 

Advanced rules and features
One puzzle per day: A new puzzle is available for everyone at midnight.
Hard Mode: For an extra challenge, players can enable Hard Mode in the settings. 
This rule requires you to use any green or yellow letters you have found in all subsequent guesses.
Curated word list: The answer is chosen from a specific list of five-letter words. 
This list excludes obscure words, vulgar terms, and most plurals ending in -S or -ES.
Sharing results: After finishing, you can click the "Share" button to copy a color-coded grid 
of your results to show friends on social media without spoiling the words.
